Operation Sandwedge was a proposed surveillance campaign that would have targeted people that U.S. president Richard Nixon
 considered his political enemies. The operation, intended to help Nixon's re-election campaign in the 1972 election, would have used 
illegal black bag operations to get information on the financial status and sexual activities of Nixon's opponents. It was also designed
 to target the Democratic Party and the antiâ€“Vietnam War movement, as well as rivals within Nixon's own Republican Party. The proposals were
 put together in 1971 by Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman, domestic affairs assistant John Ehrlichman (both pictured), and Jack Caulfield, 
a staffer. Control of the operation was passed to G. Gordon Liddy, who abandoned it in favor of a strategy of his own, Operation Gemstone, 
which included a plan to break into Democratic Party offices in the Watergate complex. Liddy's plan eventually led to the downfall of 
Nixon's presidency. (Full article...)
